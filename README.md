## The Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Lab (AIRLab) at Cornell Tech.

Our mission is to design intelligent systems (e.g., robots) that work alongside human teams in real-world, safety-critical environments (i.e., healthcare). Our research lies at the intersection of robotics, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. Through community engagement and human-centered design, we develop systems that improve teamwork and collaboration between multiple users with multi-robot systems, robot vision, AI, and AR/VR.
